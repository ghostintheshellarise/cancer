# Welcome to my blog on anything related to cancer biology
---

I'm glad you are here. I want to talk about everything about cancer.  I am going to analyse it with text analysis, system biology, or other potential computational tools that could shed light into the behavior of cancer.

Why am I doing this?  
First, my parents died from cancers.  
Second, I am fascinated by the complexity of this disease. I want to understand it in my own way.  And that is through data analysis of which I are classically trained in it.

This blog does not focus on any particular data analysis method. The spotlight is on cancer and I will use anything from ML or NLP or mathematical modeling to get the job done.

Welcome any comment and input!
